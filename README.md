# Cmel

Cmel (see-mel) is short for Caramel, the name of my cat.
It's my implementation of Lox from [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom.

## Usage

Compile the project using

```
./build.sh
```

Then, you can either run `cmel` as a REPL

```
./cmel
```

or execute a file by passing it the path

```
./cmel <filepath>
```
