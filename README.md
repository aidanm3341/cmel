# Aph
Stands for my name, **A**idan mc**PH**elim... not the best name - but it's unique and short.

This is my implementation of Lox from [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com).
There are some subtle differences/add-ons from Lox, namely;
- Ternary operator
- Print is a built-in function, rather than part of the language
- Anonymous functions
- Input function
